    <h1 id="title"> How to make Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookie Oreo Fudge Brownie Bar, also known as Slutty Brownies <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-left"></i></h1>
    <p> Your favorite guilty pleasure. The legendary Kevin and Amanda blog is to thank for this brilliant, delicious creation that satisfies the ultimate sweet tooth. An interesting approach to baking, the treat combines a moist chocolaty brownie as its top layer, with a crunchy middle base: Oreos, (America's favorite cookie) and ties it all together with chocolate chip cookies as the bottom layer. A delightful experience, I'm going to take you through the magical journey of making this incredible concoction. </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Preheat </h2>
    <img src="images/step1.jpg" alt="picture of oven" width="500">
    <p> Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, (always check to make sure there's nothing in there before you set to bake) Don't forget to use cooking spray or butter to grease your 9x9 pan in preparation for whats to come!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Step 2: Chocolate Chip Cookie Time! </h2>
    <img src="images/step2.jpg" alt="oreos over cookie dough" width="500">
    <p>Spread chocolate chip cookie dough in an even layer as the base of the creation. Don't be afraid to dig in and push the dough down to make it as even as possible. Next, place the Oreos in rows on top of the cookie dough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Step 3: Brownie Time! </h2>

    <p>Take a little break and prepare the brownie batter, once the batter is thick and completely mixed pour it over the oreos and cookie dough. Sit back and watch how satisfying it is to see brownie batter seep through the cracks and envelop the oreos!</p>
  </li>

    <h2>Step 4: Time to Bake! </h2>

    <p>The prep is complete! Stick the pan in the oven and set a timer for 40 minutes, make sure to monitor periodically. If you're not sure if the brownies are ready then test it out by using a knife or toothpick, insert it into the center and if it comes out clean then it's time to devour your creation!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Step 5: The Best Part... </h2>

    <p>Don't burn yourself! I know it's exciting, and you can't wait to try them but let the pan cool down for about 15 minutes. After that, feel free to cut into squares or just take spoonfuls! Give yourself a pat on the back you deserve these brownies!</p>
